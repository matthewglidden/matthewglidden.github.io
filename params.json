{"name":"Matthew Glidden says hi","tagline":"","body":"## Hello\r\n\r\nI'm @matthewglidden. I manage, code, interview, comedy, and baseball.\r\n\r\n## Manage\r\n\r\n13 years experience as software developer and technical program manager, [details at LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/matthewglidden).\r\n\r\n## Code\r\n\r\nPrimarily Visual Basic and C#.NET, Javascript, ruby, and perl. Several others as needed.\r\n\r\n## Interview\r\n\r\nI've interviewed Boston-area business founders since 2010. Find my shows at [Venture Cafe's blog](http://www.vencaf.org/author/matthew-glidden/) and [Studio](http://studio.vencaf.org).\r\n\r\n## Comedy\r\n\r\nDo you like standup comedy and new business ideas? I'm combining them at [District Hall](http://districthall.org) on March 17 at 6pm.\r\n\r\n## Baseball\r\n\r\nI've blogged about old-school players and collecting since 2008 at [Number 5 Type Collection](http://number5typecollection.blogspot.com).\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
